# Program 

Date: 16th September 2019.

Speaker Guidance:

All speaker slots are of approx. 20 minutes. While we can suggest a 10/10 or 15/5 time split (e.g. for vision-statement followed by discussions), speakers are encouraged to structure their time in any way they feel would be productive, engaging or beneficial for all the attendees!
